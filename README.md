**Note** this project uses nvm. You should run `nvm install` / `nvm use` before running the lines below. It _might_ work on other versions of node but has only been tested on Node 16.

```
$ npm ci
$ npm run dev
```

Navigate to whatever URL nextjs outputs. You should see the escape sequence rendered as the text of the escape rather than as a symbol.
